hi this is folder for asynchronous programming in python

You will learn:

Introduction: What is the goal of this video and what are the tools and libraries you will use

Theory: What is asynchronous programming and how it differs from synchronous or sequential programming

Coding the synchronous or sequential way: How to write a simple Python script that downloads images from pexels.com given URLs synchronously or sequentially and measures the time it takes

Coding the asynchronous way: How to write a similar Python script that downloads images from pexels.com given URLs in an asynchronous way using asyncio, await, asyncio.run method and aiohttp.ClientSession class and measures the time it takes

Comparison: How to compare the speed of execution of the two scripts and see the difference

By the end of this video, you will have a clear understanding of how to use asyncio, await, asyncio.run method and aiohttp.ClientSession class for downloading images from pexels.com given URLs asynchronously. You will also see how much faster and smoother the asynchronous way is compared to the synchronous or sequential way.
